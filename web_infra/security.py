"""Security helpers — the route guard pair (charter C-1).

`_safe_username` + `_within` are the two guards the `route-security-lint` hook
requires on every filesystem-touching route. They moved here (Sprint 8.3a) out of
`app.py` so `app.py` and every blueprint share one definition instead of
re-inlining them (`blueprints/assistant.py` carried a duplicate copy).

`_safe_username` takes an explicit `configs_dir` (keyword-only) rather than reading
a module global — that is the seam that lets a test call it with a `tmp_path`
without any Flask app context. Blueprints pass `current_app.config["CONFIGS_DIR"]`
at the call site. `_within` is pure (path + parent args) and unchanged.

P1 Hardening boundary: deterministic, no LLM calls (charter C-6). `web_infra/` is a
leaf — it never imports `app.py`, any blueprint, or `config.py`.

    A validated-resolver chokepoint that folds `Path(candidate)` +

    resolved-and-validated path**. Callers use that returned path downstream —
    never the raw input — so the value flowing into a filesystem sink derives
    from the containment check rather than from user input directly. That is the
    difference the scattered ``cp = Path(x); if not _within(cp, root): abort``
    shape could not express: there, the boolean guard and the raw `cp` are
    separate, and it is the raw `cp` that reaches the sink (often in another
    function, e.g. `hardening.context_transaction`, where a static analyzer
    can't carry the guard across the call boundary — CodeQL `py/path-injection`,
    `docs/dev/diagnosis/codeql-path-injection-context.md`).

    Containment only — existence is a separate concern. A resolved-but-absent
    path returns normally; callers still `.exists()`-check where they need to.

        candidate: The untrusted path (a request field, a filename, …).
